Welcome to BalCMS!
==================

**[BalCMS][BalCMS]** is a [Zend Framework][ZF] and [Doctrine ORM][Doctrine] powered [CMS][CMS]. It supports such features as il8n, widget, caching, themes and modules. Modules is really important as you can just add your own module, a route to the module and bang you have just extended the CMS and you can add your own actions! Now this is cool, unlike wordpress plugins. :O
