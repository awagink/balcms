You should have received along with BalCMS:
- A copy of the licenses used.

There is a strong belief within us that the licenses we have chosen provides not only the best solution for providing you with the essential freedom necessary to use BalCMS within your projects, but also for maintaining enough copyleft strength for us to feel confident and secure with releasing our hard work to the public. For your convenience we've included our own interpretation of the licenses we selected, which can be seen below.

This is our interpretation of both the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 and the GNU General Public License 2:
(Quoted words are words in which there exists a definition within the license to avoid ambiguity.)
  1. You must always provide the source code, copyright and license information of BalCMS whenever you "convey"/"distribute" any part of BalCMS;
       be it a verbatim copy or a modified copy.
  2. BalCMS was developed and has been provided for the purpose of functioning as a software library.
     As such it has been developed without any sufficient knowledge about the inner workings of the works which it will be "aggregated" or "used" with.
     As such it can not be considered a work which is "based on" or "derived" from the works which it will be "aggregated" or "used with", i.e. your work.
     This provides the following implications:
       a) You are free to use BalCMS in a work covered by the following licenses:
            - GNU General Public License version 2
            - GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
          This is due to those licenses acknowledging that work which is not "based on" their work to fall under the a special "aggregate" use case.
          This allows for BalCMS to act as an "aggregated" work and be covered by it's own licensing decisions
            regardless of the license of the work BalCMS would be "aggregating" with.
          You may find the relevant passages of those licenses which document this starting at:
            - Line 129 of the GNU General Public License version 2
            - Line 206 of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
      b) If you have developed works which "aggregate" the BalCMS codebase (such as additional modules, plugins, helpers, etc) then
           those works are not bound by this license; as they are considered "aggregate" works.
      b) If you have developed works which do not "modify", "adapt" or "extend" the BalCMS codebase (such as independent programs) then
           those works are not bound by this license; as they are considered "aggregate" works.
      c) If you have developed works which "modify", "adapt" or "extend" the BalCMS codebase then
           those works are indeed bound by this license; as they are considered performed under the definition of a "based on" work.
